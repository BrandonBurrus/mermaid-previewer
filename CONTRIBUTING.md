## Project Overview

Some background: This project was meant to just be a simple tool to make writing diagrams using the
lovely Mermaid.js syntax easier. It is meant as a command line alternative to the official [Mermaid
Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/), with the specific goal of allowing
users to use their preferred editor instead of a web editor.

That being said, features, bugfixes, and improvements are welcome! Generally it is recommended to
first open an [Issue on Github](https://github.com/BrandonBurrus/mermaid-previewer/issues) first,
however because this is a small project, directly opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/BrandonBurrus/mermaid-previewer/pulls)
is totally ok!

Please remember that Mermaid does have an official [CLI tool](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)
already. If you are considering adding a new feature, please be sure to check to see if this
existing tool would already meet your use-case.
